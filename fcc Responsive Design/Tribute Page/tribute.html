          <p class="bold tribute-line">Here's a time line of Steven Paul Job's life:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1955</span> - Born in San Francisco, California, U.S.A.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1973</span> - Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs.
              According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company, and they thought that he had built it himself.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1975</span> - Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1976</span> - When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together,
              which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design.
              The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1977</span> - The then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock, which after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show,
              started with a $60,000 investment and went on the Apple board.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1983</span> - The company recruited PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation.
              Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1984</span> - Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign.
              It would later be pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.” However, the first Macs were underpowered and expensive, and they had few software applications—all of which resulted in disappointing sales
              Jobs’s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly led to tensions in the company, and in 1985 Sculley convinced Apple’s board of directors to remove the company’s famous cofounder
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1985</span> - Jobs founded NeXT Inc. His funding partners included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design,
              it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Inc.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1986</span> - Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million,
              $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1997</span> - Apple buys NeXT for $400 million, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">1998</span> - Jobs introduced the iMac, an egg-shaped, one-piece computer that offered high-speed processing at a relatively modest price and initiated a trend of high-fashion computers.
              (Subsequent models sported five different bright colours.)
              By the end of the year, the iMac was the nation’s highest-selling personal computer, and Jobs was able to announce consistent profits for the once-moribund company.
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">2001</span> - Jobs started reinventing Apple for the 21st century.
              That was the year that Apple introduced iTunes, a computer program for playing music and for converting music to the compact MP3 digital format commonly used in computers and other digital devices.
              Later the same year, Apple began selling the iPod, a portable MP3 player, which quickly became the market leader
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">2006</span> - Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion.
              Upon completion of the merger, Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder
            </li>
            <li class="tribute-lists">
              <span class="bold">2007</span> - Jobs officially changed the name of the company to Apple Inc. Jobs took the company into the telecommunications business with the introduction of the touch-screen iPhone,
              a mobile telephone with capabilities for playing MP3s and videos and for accessing the Internet.
              Later that year, Apple introduced the iPod Touch, a portable MP3 and gaming device that included built-in Wi-Fi and an iPhone-like touch screen.

        <p>
          For what characterizes Apple is that its scientific staff always acted and performed like artists – in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit, Apple's engineering teams had passion.
          They always believed that what they were doing was important and, most of all, fun. Working at Apple was never just a job; it was also a crusade, a mission, to bring better computer power to people. At its roots, that attitude came from Steve Jobs.
          It was "Power to the People", the slogan of the sixties, rewritten in technology for the eighties and called Macintosh.
